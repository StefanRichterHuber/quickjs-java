[features]
# Enables a workround, that sets the locale for a js eval /  function invocation. This is necessary due to a bug in QuickJS <https://github.com/bellard/quickjs/issues/106>
# which makes float parsing dependent on current locale. Starting a JVM sets a locale, so on some systems with ',' as decimal separator (e.g. german systems) parsing float values fails.
# These values are then recognized as int values (part after the ',' is just discarded) (see <https://github.com/DelSkayn/rquickjs/issues/281>)
